RummiRogue details

basic rules for default rummikub
  -106 tiles, 1->13, 2 jokers, Y/R/BLK/BLU
  -group (3 colors)
  -run (consecutive 3)
  
start by taking 14 tiles
can only place on table if able to make 30 pts (can not use tiles already played on the table)
cannot lay tile just drawn, must wait till next turn

joker can be taken from the table and replaced by a valid tile, but must be played not 'kept'
joker has any value or any color

-1 min time limit if exceeded draw 3 tiles

winning can achieved via round limit or clearing your rack

if rummi achieved players add up value on rack as negative values (joker on rack is 30)
if pool is emptied before rummi, player with lowest rack wins round
1->13 x 4 (colors) x 2 (double each color) + 2 jokers = 103


the winner gets the positive amount of tiles remaining on each players rack
ie player 1 (W)  + 12, player 2 (L) -5, player 3 (L) -7


--design considerations--

struct for sets
struct for pool 
struct for rack
struct for tile
struct for table

tiles array size 106
pool max size 106
rack max size 53 (bot/pool/table has other 53)

table has max size 106 tiles
table has max sets 36

set {
    Type(Run, Group)
    Tiles[13]
    ValidTiles[3] ie {(2,R),(3,R),(4,R)} valid tiles are {(1,R),(5,R),(J,X)} // don't forget jokers
  }
